# TomatoTube

TomatoTube is a [Pomorodo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer integrated with a video-playing feature. TomatoTube follows the timer and switches to the correct video depending on if you are in a work session or break session.

## Motivation

When using the Pomodoro Technique and working with a video playing in the background, pausing or switching videos every 5 to 25 minutes is a hassle. Not wanting to be distracted by having to pause my video or change tabs, I made this website for a more automatic and unified Pomodoro experience.
